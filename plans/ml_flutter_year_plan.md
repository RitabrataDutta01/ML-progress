# ðŸ“… ML + Flutter Year Plan (2025)

This document outlines a structured, month-by-month roadmap for learning Machine Learning (ML) using *ISL* and *AurÃ©lien GÃ©ronâ€™s Hands-On ML*, alongside Flutter for app development. The plan combines theory, practical coding, and final projects.

## ðŸ§  Tips

- Use `topics/machine_learning.md` and `topics/flutter.md` to record detailed notes.
- Track your daily tasks in the `daily/` folder with a template.
- Update your progress monthly by reflecting in each section.
- Cross-reference projects inside topic or journal notes using `[Link](../plans/ml_flutter_year_plan.md)`.
