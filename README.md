# üöÄ My Machine Learning Progress & Learning Notes

Hey there! üëã Welcome to my personal space dedicated to tracking my progress and consolidating notes on my Machine Learning journey. This repository serves as a live log, capturing my daily learning insights, project plans, datasets I'm experimenting with, and various code implementations as I grow my skills in the ML world.

## üìö What's Inside This Repo?

This repository is structured to help me keep various aspects of my ML learning organized. Here‚Äôs a quick overview of what you'll find:

| Directory/File         | What it Contains                                                         |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Notes/daily/`         | My daily learning logs, quick thoughts on new concepts, and coding snippets from practice. |
| `Notes/plans/`         | My roadmap for future learning, ideas for upcoming ML projects, and long-term goals. |
| `Notes/datasets used/` | Datasets I'm using for hands-on practice with different ML models and algorithms. |
| `Notes/index.md`       | A central overview, possibly with links to key topics or summary of progress milestones. |
| `Notes/progress.md`    | Broader progress updates, personal reflections, and insights gained during my learning. |
| `code/`                | Where I'll store my implementations of ML algorithms, small project code, or Jupyter notebooks. |
| `requirements.txt`     | A list of all Python package dependencies required to run the code and notebooks here. |
| `.gitignore`           | Configuration for Git, telling it which files and directories (like my `venv/`) to ignore. |

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to Get Started & Run the Code

If you're curious to explore the code or notebooks, here‚Äôs how you can set up this repository locally:

1.  **Clone the repository to your machine:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/RitabrataDutta01/ML-progress.git](https://github.com/RitabrataDutta01/ML-progress.git)
    cd ML-progress/
    ```

2.  **Set up your Python Virtual Environment:**
    (Recommended for managing dependencies cleanly on your Fedora system!)

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the environment
    ```

3.  **Install all necessary Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Explore the content:**
    * **To read notes:** Just open the Markdown files (`.md`) in your favorite text editor (like VS Code) or use a Markdown viewer.
        ```bash
        # Example: to view a daily note in your terminal
        cat Notes/daily/2025-06-24.md
        ```
    * **To run Jupyter Notebooks:** If you activate your `venv` and run `jupyter notebook`, you can then navigate through the browser interface to any `.ipynb` file (e.g., `Notes/datasets used/LinearRegression.ipynb`).
        ```bash
        jupyter notebook
        ```
    * **To run Python scripts:** Navigate to the `code/` directory and run your scripts.
        ```bash
        cd code/
        # Example: python my_ml_script.py
        ```
